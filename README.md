# gms-animation-systemation

A basic animation system for GMS1.4.

## Summary

This is a fairly basic animation system for GMS1.4 that I developed for a personal project, and have decided to release. It allows you to swap between animations through a simple entrypoint (`scr_animation_change`) while also allowing you to have character or entity-specific animations. It has supported for looping, holding, sounds, effects, and other such things.

There is also a basic squash/stretch system in place, which can be used in the animation system, or elsewhere.

## Features

- Looping animations set amount of times
- Animation transitions
- Sounds/effects on certain frames
- Holding frame(s)
- Squash/stretch
